# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests -> Present options -> Execute choice -> Clean up.

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2. Report failures.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

```bash
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

### Step 4: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally
```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <feature-branch>
<test command>
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR
```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
# Create PR with summary and test plan
```

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is
Report: "Keeping branch <name>."

#### Option 4: Discard
**Confirm first** -- list what will be deleted. Wait for explicit confirmation.

```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
