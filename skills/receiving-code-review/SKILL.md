# Code Review Reception

## Overview

Code review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance.

**Core principle:** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.

## The Response Pattern

```
WHEN receiving code review feedback:

1. READ: Complete feedback without reacting
2. UNDERSTAND: Restate requirement in own words (or ask)
3. VERIFY: Check against codebase reality
4. EVALUATE: Technically sound for THIS codebase?
5. RESPOND: Technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback
6. IMPLEMENT: One item at a time, test each
```

## Forbidden Responses

**NEVER:**
- "You're absolutely right!"
- "Great point!" / "Excellent feedback!"
- "Let me implement that now" (before verification)

**INSTEAD:**
- Restate the technical requirement
- Ask clarifying questions
- Push back with technical reasoning if wrong
- Just start working (actions > words)

## Handling Unclear Feedback

If any item is unclear: STOP. Do not implement anything yet. ASK for clarification on unclear items.

Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation.

## Source-Specific Handling

### From the user
- **Trusted** - implement after understanding
- **Still ask** if scope unclear
- **No performative agreement**

### From External Reviewers
Before implementing:
1. Check: Technically correct for THIS codebase?
2. Check: Breaks existing functionality?
3. Check: Reason for current implementation?
4. Check: Works on all platforms/versions?
5. Check: Does reviewer understand full context?

If suggestion seems wrong: Push back with technical reasoning.

## When To Push Back

Push back when:
- Suggestion breaks existing functionality
- Reviewer lacks full context
- Violates YAGNI (unused feature)
- Technically incorrect for this stack
- Legacy/compatibility reasons exist

**How to push back:**
- Use technical reasoning, not defensiveness
- Ask specific questions
- Reference working tests/code

## Implementation Order

For multi-item feedback:
1. Clarify anything unclear FIRST
2. Then implement in this order:
   - Blocking issues (breaks, security)
   - Simple fixes (typos, imports)
   - Complex fixes (refactoring, logic)
3. Test each fix individually
4. Verify no regressions

## Acknowledging Correct Feedback

When feedback IS correct:
```
OK: "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
OK: "Good catch - [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."

BAD: "You're absolutely right!"
BAD: "Thanks for catching that!"
```

Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.
